This allows you to disable some commonly used commands,
so none can use them. It'll also allow you to autodelete them, 
stopping people from bluetexting.

**Admin commands:**

Ã— /disable `<commandname>`: Stop users from using commandname in this group.
Ã— /enable `<item name>`: Allow users from using commandname in this group.
Ã— /disableable: List all disableable commands.
Ã— /disabledel `<yes/no/on/off>`: Delete disabled commands when used by non-admins.
Ã— /disabled: List the disabled commands in this chat.

**Note:**
When disabling a command, the command only gets disabled for non-admins.
All admins can still use those commands.
